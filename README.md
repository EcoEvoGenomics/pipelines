# EcoEvoGenomics Nextflow Pipelines
### Introduction
Welcome to the [`pipelines`](https://github.com/EcoEvoGenomics/pipelines) repository! Here you will find self-contained, reproducible Nextflow pipelines to run the many steps involved in common analyses automatically and in one terminal command. This *enormously* simplifies the process of e.g. producing a PCA and ADMIXTURE analysis from a VCF generated with our [`genotyping_pipeline`](https://github.com/EcoEvoGenomics/genotyping_pipeline), or a phylogeny of mitochondrial haplotypes from CRAMs.
